There are three types of section: <b><i>Visible (public)</i></b> where tickets are visible by the board community, <b><i>Visible (private)</i></b> where a user will see only his own tickets, and <b><i>Hidden</i></b> meaning that the section is for the staff members. When you turn the status of a section to <b><i>Frozen</i></b>, posting will not be possible (except for Administrator).
