The ext/ directory must be WRITABLE.

----------------------------------------------------
Advanced setup: memcache/sse using a separate server
----------------------------------------------------

About Server-sent events. When memcache uses an other server, the SSE (if used) must also use that server (sse and memcache cannot be separated).

If you want to configure an other server for the memcache, you have to edit configuration files on both servers:
the application server must point to the memcache server, while the memcache server will use localhost.
To do this, follow these 3 steps: 

a) Copy the ext/ directory to the memcache server.

b) Settings for the application server (ext/ directory)
   - In the config_mem.php file, specify the address of the memcache server with MEMCACHE_HOST and MEMCACHE_PORT
   - In the config_sse.php file, specify the address of the memcache server with SSE_SERVER and SSE_ORIGIN
     Note:
     SSE_SERVER must be the Path to the ext directory on the memcache server (with final /) ex: "http://srv01.domain.com/app/qti/"
     SSE_ORIGIN must be the domain name ex: "http://srv01.domain.com"
   
c) Settings for the memcache server (ext/ directory)
   - In the config_mem.php file, specify "localhost" as address with MEMCACHE_HOST and MEMCACHE_PORT
   - The config_sse.php file is not used and can be deleted on the memcache server.
   
Notes:
The ext directory is writable on the application server, but is not required to be writable on the memcache server.
